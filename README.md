## About
Each of the 8 accent colors corresponds to a CTA train line: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Pink, and Brown.

### Day
The background and foregrounds are lighter, drawing from Chicago's natural elements. Think light greens for parks (base00), soft blues for Lake Michigan (base02), and muted browns for brickwork and trees (base05). This palette aims for good readability and a comfortable, airy feel for your coding sessions.

### Night
The background and foreground shades are inspired by the textures and tones of Chicago's urban environment â€“ from the deep asphalt of the streets and the vast night sky (base00) to the glint of stainless steel (base05) and the weathered look of its bridges and structures (base03). It's a palette designed for clarity and focus, reflecting the city's strong lines and enduring presence.
